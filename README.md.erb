# What is this?
 - Something you come up with when you know a little ruby and words 'public_exec' stuck in your head for a couple days

### <%= c = "cat spec/show_off_spec.rb" %>
```ruby
<%= `#{c}` %>
```

### Red Bikini?
- Red for ruby, bikini for informal communication

### Why?
- It just would not let me go

### So...
Well, you`ll probably find thousand reasons not to use it yourself, 
  but I would be really glad if it would make it`s way to some DSL ))


  Check out other spec files for gotchas:
  <%= %w[closure_binding typing operators].map{|spec| spec = "spec/#{spec}_spec.rb";"[#{spec}](#{spec})"}.join "\n" %>

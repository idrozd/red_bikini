# What is this?
Something you come up with when you know a little ruby and words 'public_exec' stuck in your head for a couple days

### <%= c = "cat spec/show_off_spec.rb" %>
```ruby
<%= `#{c}` %>
```

### Red Bikini?
Red for ruby, bikini for informal communication

### Why?
It just would not let me go

### So...
You probably shouldn't use this for serious things, but I wouldn't discourage you from it of course.
Some kind of DSL sounds as a candidate topic.

Check out other specs for gotchas.
I would note that inside it uses instance exec applied to a wrapper around
reciever, so it wouldn`t bind calling context methods (which is good), 
but binds locals and constants.
- Also, or/equal (||=) won`t work directly without specifiyng explicit receiver of course (_self will work)
- Also, self wouldn't work with case operator - I don't want to hack reciever class .=== just for that.
Although, you may use _self for this (original object).

<% %w[closure_binding typing operators aliases collisions].each do |spec| %>
- <%= spec = "spec/#{spec}_spec.rb";"[#{spec}](#{spec})"%>
<% end %>
